        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These fried soft-shell crabs are crisp and delicious — you can eat the whole crab! This is my favorite food.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 soft-shell crabs</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lift one pointed side of the top shell of one crab; pull out and discard the gills. Lower the shell and repeat on the other side. Remove the tail flap on the bottom side by twisting and pulling. Use a pair of scissors to cut behind the eyes and remove the face. Repeat to clean remaining crabs. Rinse cleaned crabs thoroughly with cold water, then dry on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together milk and egg in a shallow bowl. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in another shallow bowl. Lightly salt each crab. Dredge in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Working in batches if necessary, carefully lower crabs into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
